MDPy is a **GPU** accelerated Molecular Dynamics (MD) package based on **Python**, distributed freely under the terms of **BSD** License. It is designed for researchers with no c++ or fortran coding background to efficiently implement new theoretical model with GPU acceleration.

MDPy is developed and maintaining by **Zhenyu Wei** (zhenyuwei99@gmail.com), from **Yunfei Chen**'s group in Southeast University. As a newly developed program, we always welcome developers to contact us or discuss in our `Github site <https://github.com/mdpy-dev/mdpy>`_

The document is organized in four parts

1. Quick start part
2. Theory behind MDPy part
3. Tutorial part
4. API reference part

.. tip::

   Once you are familiar with MDPy, The API reference part will be useful for quick code check
