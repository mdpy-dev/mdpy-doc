Beta version
------------


We strongly recommend to install mdpy from source code. First you need clone this repository to your local device:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/mdpy-dev/mdpy.git


Then go to the path of mdpy, running:

.. code:: bash

    conda install --file requirements.txt -c defaults -c conda-forge
    conda develop .

Now all the change made on the mdpy source code can be reveal in your code without reinstalling mdpy package.
